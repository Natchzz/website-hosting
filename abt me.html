    <p align="center" id="p1">Hello everyone, I am Floyd Mark K. Ancheta, 20 years old from Sitio Departe, Bgry. Bantog Asingan Pangasinan. 
        <br>We are four siblings and I am the youngest. My father’s name is Primo Ancheta and my mother’s name is Virginia Ancheta.
        <br> 
        <br>I enjoy exploring things as they give me excitement that I always want to feel. 
        <br>Playing online games and sports are some of my pastime activities and I do also enjoy reading books and studying.
        <br>
        <br>I studied elementary at Ariston-Bantog elementary school and Lucia  no Millan National Highschool in junior high and senior high. 
        <br>Currently, I am studying at Pangasinan State University Urdaneta campus as a computer engineering student and am currently in my second year. 
        <br>
        <br>In the first years of my journey as a computer engineering student, 
        <br>I experienced a lot of hardships and different emotions. But those experiences helped me grow and become who I am right now. 
        <br>I hope that I will grow more not just as a student but also as an individual for my remaining years on campus. 
        <br>
